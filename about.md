My name's Matthew Herman. I am a software engineer from Milwaukee, WI. I graduated with a BS in Software Engineering (and minor in Mathematics) from the Milwaukee School of Engineering in 2015. 

In my day job I work with a range of technologies: C#/.NET, SQL Server, Postgres, RabbitMQ, React, and Angular. I also work with a variety of cloud native technologies and I am an AWS Certified Solutions Architect. 

In my free time I enjoy exploring other programming languages such as F#, Go, Rust, and Common Lisp. My non-programming hobbies include spending time with my wife and two dogs, reading science fiction and fantasy books, and various outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, and hiking.
