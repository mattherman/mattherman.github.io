This year I decided to join the [Seven Day Roguelike (7DRL)][7drl] game jam. It's a week long event where participants spend time creating new roguelike games, individually or as a team. Games in this genre vary greatly but generally have the following elements:
1) Permadeath - players are unable to respawn after death, they must start the game from scratch
2) Procedural content - levels, enemies, and items are unique within each play of the game
3) Turn based - gameplay is turn based, encouraging tactics over reflexes
4) ASCII or tile graphics

Some popular traditional roguelike games are NetHack, Angband, ADOM, and (of course) Rogue. Some newer games include DCSS, Brogue, and Cogmind.
